## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Tables
- **admin_users**: Admin credentials
- **menu_items**: Cafe menu with prices and availability
- **orders**: Customer orders with status and payment info
- **order_items**: Items in each order
- **staff**: Staff members with roles and salaries
- **attendance**: Staff attendance records
- **service_requests**: Waiter call requests

## 🎯 Usage Workflow

1. **Admin Setup**:
   - Login as admin
   - Add/manage menu items
   - Generate QR codes for tables
   - Print and place QR codes on tables

2. **Customer Ordering**:
   - Scan QR code on table
   - Browse menu and add items to cart
   - Add special instructions (optional)
   - Place order
   - **Pay via Demo Mode** (for presentations) or Real UPI
   - Track order status in real-time

### 💡 Demo Payment Mode (For Presentations)

Perfect for degree project demonstrations on mobile devices!

**How to use:**
1. Place an order from the menu
2. On the order tracking page, scroll to **"Demo Payment Options"**
3. Click one of:
   - 💵 **Pay with Cash** (Demo)
   - 💳 **Pay with Card** (Demo)  
   - 📱 **Pay with UPI** (Demo)
4. Order is automatically marked as PAID and sent to kitchen
5. Watch it appear on the staff kitchen display!

**Why this is useful:**
- No real payment needed during demonstrations
- Works perfectly on mobile phones
- Shows complete ordering workflow
- Impresses project evaluators! 🎓

**Note:** Real UPI payment is also available for actual deployment.

3. **Kitchen Processing**:
   - Staff login to kitchen display (auto-marked as Present)
   - View pending orders with real-time stats
   - Start cooking and set estimated time
   - Mark orders as ready when done
   - Mark as served when picked up

4. **Admin Monitoring**:
   - View analytics and revenue
   - Monitor all orders with filtering
   - Manage staff attendance
   - Mark remaining staff as absent (end of day)
   - Update menu availability

## 🎯 Smart Attendance System

### How It Works
1. **Automatic Present Marking**: When staff logs into the kitchen dashboard, they are automatically marked as "Present" for today
2. **Manual Override**: Admin can manually mark any staff as Present or Absent from the dashboard
3. **Bulk Absent Marking**: Admin can click "Mark Remaining as Absent" button to automatically mark all staff who haven't logged in as Absent
4. **Daily Tracking**: Each staff member's attendance is tracked per day with timestamps

### Admin Attendance Management
- View today's attendance status for all staff
- Manually mark individual staff present/absent
- Use bulk absent marking at end of day
- Color-coded status indicators (Green = Present, Red = Absent)

## 🔧 Customization

### Change UPI ID
Edit `track_order.php` line 23:
```php
$my_upi_id = "your-upi-id@bank";
```

### Change Number of Tables
Default is 20 tables. Modify in `generate_qr.php` or use URL parameter:
```
generate_qr.php?tables=50
```

### Change Base URL
Edit `generate_qr.php` line 10 if deploying online:
```php
$base_url = "https://yourdomain.com/menu.php?table_id=";
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Error
- Check if MySQL is running in XAMPP
- Verify database name is `cafe_project` in `db_connect.php`
- Ensure `setup.sql` has been imported

### QR Codes Not Loading
- Check internet connection (uses online QR API)
- Alternative: Install a local QR library

### Orders Not Updating
- Clear browser cache
- Check if form submissions are working
- Verify database connection

## 📝 Future Enhancements

- SMS/Email notifications
- Multiple restaurant support
- Mobile app (React Native/Flutter)
- Order history for customers
- Inventory management
- Report generation (PDF)
